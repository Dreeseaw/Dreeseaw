## Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer who loves making data go fast (safely!). I currently work as a Data Engineer for Chartbeat, where I design & develop systems for processing realtime & historical data at terabyte scale.

### Currently, I'm
- 🎛 Learning about distributed systems and data storage
- ✅ Trying to get better at Open Source contributions
- 🐠 Working on my own distributed stream processing package, [Salmon](https://github.com/Dreeseaw/salmon "Be warned, it's a WIP")
- 🦦 Using Go for all of the above!

### Previously, I've worked on
- ✈️ Realtime data synchronization for military [surveillance](https://www.logostech.net/products/kestrel-block-ii/ "No weapons/targeting involved")
- 🖍 A Convolutional VAE model that labeled micro-grain sizes for material scientists (deployed internally)
- 🔬 Published [ML research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05863.pdf "Learned Neural Iterative Decoding for Lossy Image Compression Systems") on improving JPEG image quality
- 🖥 A full-stack application for a start-up idea (before realizing it didn't have any product-market fit)

### Fun facts
- My dog's name is Hamels
- Name a flavor of Ben & Jerry's, and I'll name every ingredient
