## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who loves making data go fast (safely!). Interested in database internals, distributed computing, & realtime architectures. I currently work as a Data Engineer for Chartbeat, where I develop systems for processing realtime & historical data at terabyte scale.

### Open Source Work
- Contributions to [column](https://github.com/kelindar/column "")
- A home-cooked recurrent NN for [predicting ETF prices](https://github.com/Dreeseaw/Sector-Rotation-RNN "")
- Published [ML research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05863.pdf "Learned Neural Iterative Decoding for Lossy Image Compression Systems") on improving JPEG image quality
- A Google Cloud Function for Twitch chat to trigger a streamer's smart lights [using webhooks](https://gist.github.com/Dreeseaw/c83f0e5c7c6502f383913f47a0827d18 "") (built live on stream!)
